            <p class="content-p">At Chess Champions, we believe in a hands on approach to help kids understand chess.
                Typically, we will start off our meetings by solving a simple chess puzzles together while also going
                over a new chess opening.
                After our warmup, kids will be paired off with an opponent of a similar skill level in order to improve
                their gameplay. In chess,
                we learn through others.</p>
